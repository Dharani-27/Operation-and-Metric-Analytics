# Operation and Metric Analytics
Operational Analytics is a crucial process that involves analyzing a company's end-to-end operations. This analysis helps identify areas for improvement within the company. As a Data Analyst, you'll work closely with various teams, such as operations, support, and marketing, helping them derive valuable insights from the data they collect. 

One of the key aspects of Operational Analytics is investigating metric spikes. This involves understanding and explaining sudden changes in key metrics, such as a dip in daily user engagement or a drop in sales. As a Data Analyst, you'll need to answer these questions daily, making it crucial to understand how to investigate these metric spikes.  

In this project, you'll take on the role of a Lead Data Analyst at a company like Microsoft. You'll be provided with various datasets and tables, and your task will be to derive insights from this data to answer questions posed by different departments within the company. Your goal is to use your advanced SQL skills to analyze the data and provide valuable insights that can help improve the company's operations and understand sudden changes in key metrics.
